            The ongoing digital revolution is transforming economies and driving innovation across all economic 
            Africa and its leaders are faced with the double challenge of achieving SDG targets while adapting to climate 
            Digitally transforming all elements of the continent's economy â€“ from education to healthcare, 
            agriculture to telecommunications will require innovative solutions and inclusive finance strategies.

        For Africa to achieve its true potential, its people need to be empowered with the necessary digital competencies.
          Africans need access to digital tools and technologies, while operating within a regulatory environment that protects
          the safety and interests of all people.

              When you consider the historiography of the internet and digital innovation, 
              little is written about Africa's role. Although illiteracy among adults in sub-Saharan Africa was 34.7% in 2019,
              innovation on the continent has taken different forms thanks to the richness of its culture and lifestyle.
              For example, inclusive innovation can be viewed from the lens of the many artisans and inventors in Kumasi Magazine.
              By shifting the lens through which we understand the people's pain points, 
              we can develop cutting-edge solutions through appreciative inquiry.
